This is the technology blog of Tobias Fenster, Managing Director at <a href="https://www.4ps.de" target="_blank">4PS Germany</a>, <a href="https://rd.microsoft.com/en-us/tobias-fenster">Microsoft Regional Directory</a> and dual <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002758?fullName=Tobias%20Fenster" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.com/captains/tobias-fenster/">Docker Captain</a>. I usually write about Dynamics 365 (most history on NAV / Business Central), Azure and Docker. Coming from a development background but with also a lot of experience around infrastructure and operations, my topics range from dev to ops and of course DevOps. While working for one of my previous employers, I blogged <a href="https://www.axians-infoma.com/techblog/">here</a> since October 2016.

This blog is a personal effort, so it doesn't necessarily show in which direction my employer is going or what technologies are relevant there.
